## About the project

---

**_This project is in progress_**

This is a personal project based on my experience as a Primary Teacher. After facing different situations where resources and tools were insuficient or not efficient and intuitive, evolves the need to create a tool to manage daily tasks and routines in the classroom environment. From this need appears "MySchoolMate".

MySchoolMate will become a classroom management tool for teachers, with different functionalities to deal with the most automatic tasks of the teaching job in a quick and efficient way, to leave time for what really matters: the actual teaching.

This is an ongoing project with the aim to make a powerfull tool for teachers, in first instance, and for schools and families in the future.
